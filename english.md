Even more intimate is that even [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/zh-CN/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) Web proxy extensions are available. NordVPN also has a strict log-free policy, automatic Kill Switch, [DNS leak](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/47095852) protection, Onion Over VPN and other functions.

## VPN Recommended Standard

![VPN recommendation](/image/standard.jpg)

Before choosing a VPN, I suggest that you consider these selection criteria instead of paying for them blindly.

### Recommend a stable and reliable VPN

Nowadays, due to the tightening of domestic policies, the strength of the wall is more strict. The ordinary VPN traffic is easily seen by the wall. Once the characteristic traffic is found in a large area of ​​some IPs, this IP segment cannot be used basically. The VPN recommended in this article has been rigorously tested by myself, rather than other online recommendations, and I have recommended it to others if I have never used it. I usually use a few of them in my daily life. At least I have to prepare two hands to prevent the ladder from falling outside the wall. After all, for those who advocate freedom, VPN is a necessity.

### Recommended paid first-line VPN

Free VPN sounds tempting, but it really takes a lot of trouble to really use it. After all, the wool is on the sheep, and people are also making money. Then these so-called free VPNs will make money through other means, such as full-screen pop-up ads and sales of personal information. In addition, most free VPNs are basically in an unusable state, and network delays are horrendous, such as the free version of [Lantern](https://getlantern.org/zh_CN/index.html). And if you want a stable service, you still need to buy his paid version. To put it bluntly, free is just a marketing tool.

### Recommend foreign VPN merchants

Since the beginning of the past few years in China, the government has clearly stated that it is illegal for companies that are not authorized to provide VPN services. I think everyone has heard of some companies or individuals engaged in VPN sales and caught news. Therefore, the domestic VPN service providers are running sooner or later, but it is only a matter of time. And once the company is blocked, you will definitely hand in your VPN usage record, and you will be the key object of prevention in the future. If you are unfortunately paying an annual fee, then a refund is definitely not possible. It is illegal to use VPN. You can't take legal proceedings.

### Not recommended to crack VPN software

There are a lot of scorpions on the Internet that use the VPN cracking version to swindle and swindle. Each VPN account is a separate key. The server can even limit the login device of each account. What's more, the technical team of VPN is the most important indicator. The complexity of the server is unimaginable. If you retire 10,000 steps, if someone cracks it, he will not be able to use it for free. After downloading and installing, most of them are either viruses or rogue software.

### Recommend to support VPN for all terminal devices

Before choosing a VPN, it is necessary to look at Android, iOS and other mobile operating systems, as well as tablets, computers, etc. This is also an aspect of examining the comprehensive strength of VPN businesses. Other devices are basically supported by all businesses, mainly Apple devices. After all, Apple is particularly cooperating with domestic censorship, and Cook is fast enough to be a party activist.

## Other methods

In fact, there are other methods, the principle is the same, only need to be a server in foreign countries, then you can buy foreign VPS to build, now the mainstream is to install Shadowsocks or V2Ray, VPS location is best to choose the United States is more stable The VPS of [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8148224) is recommended, and the line is stable and affordable. [Shadowsocks build tutorial](https://github.com/233boy/ss/wiki/Shadowsocks%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA%E8%AF%A6%E7%BB%86%E5%9B% BE%E6%96%87%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B) There is a detailed construction process, [V2Ray](https://www.v2ray.com/) is also relatively hot recently, similar to Shadowsocks The construction is not complicated, the official website provides a detailed construction process, and also provides client software. Of course, it is not recommended to buy some paid Shadowsocks. After all, Shadowsocks and its upgraded SSR code are open source and easy to crack.

## Some questions about VPN

![What is VPN](/image/question.jpg)

### What is the basic principle of VPN?

Vpn is the abbreviation of English Virtual Private Network, translated as [virtual private network](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%99%9B%E6%93%AC%E7%A7%81%E4 %BA%BA%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF). The VPN was originally designed to allow any two computers in the world to transmit data in an encrypted channel. It is only encrypted on the data, not on the hardware, so it is called virtual. It has therefore become a tool to bypass the review. VPN is more basic than [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html). It first virtualizes a network card through the operating system. After that, the data is encrypted by this network card. .

### Why are most VPNs unstable?

Now the domestic censorship system is very strict. I have written a VPN recommendation to know that the articles have been deleted, not to mention the fact that the merchants selling VPNs will be severely hit. Moreover, for a normal VPN, although the message content is encrypted, the message protocol is very detectable. If some small businesses use some open source protocols, the chances of being detected by the wall will increase greatly. For first-line merchants, they have the resources to do some secondary development on existing agreements to bypass the detection of the wall.

### What should I pay attention to when using VPN?

First of all, it is illegal to use VPN. However, the number of users using VPN in China is extremely large. It is impossible to punish all of them. It can only be said that killing chickens and monkeys, such as some [news using VPN](https:/ /www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-46823319). Of course, this is not to say that the punishment is random, but the first to punish those who browsed foreign politically sensitive websites and spread them. Therefore, when using VPN, you must remember to read-only, that is, only read information, not to spread information.
