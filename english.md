## Select VPN standard

Before choosing a VPN, I suggest that you consider these selection criteria.

### Select a stable and available VPN

Nowadays, due to the tightening of domestic policies, the strength of the wall is more strict. The ordinary VPN traffic is easily seen by the wall. Once the characteristic traffic is found in a large area of ​​some IPs, this IP segment cannot be used basically. The VPN recommended in this article has been rigorously tested by myself, rather than other online recommendations, and I have recommended it to others if I have never used it. I usually use a few of them in my daily life. At least I have to prepare two hands to prevent the ladder from falling outside the wall. After all, for those who advocate freedom, VPN is a necessity.

### Select a paid VPN

Free VPN sounds tempting, but it really takes a lot of trouble to really use it. After all, the wool is on the sheep, and people are also making money. Then these so-called free VPNs will make money through other means, such as full-screen pop-up ads and sales of personal information. In addition, most free VPNs are basically in an unusable state, and network delays are horrendous, such as the free version of [lantern](https://getlantern.org). And if you want a stable service, you still need to buy his paid version. To put it bluntly, free is just a marketing tool.

### Choosing a big brand VPN

There are countless VPN products on the market, but most of them are in an unusable state. In order to make money, many merchants find a VPN software and start to sell it. The trial is very fast, and after you have purchased their products, they are completely different. Moreover, many small businesses lack the encryption strength, the technology is not in place, and it is basically streaking in front of the wall. The policy is strict or some special period, it is easy to be sealed in a large area.

### Select a VPN that supports all terminal devices

Before choosing a VPN, it is necessary to look at whether all terminals are supported. Other devices are basically supported by all businesses, mainly Apple devices. After all, Apple is particularly cooperating with domestic censorship, and Cook is fast enough to be a party activist.

## Some questions about VPN

### What is the basic principle of VPN?

Vpn is the abbreviation of [Virtual Private Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network). The VPN was originally designed to allow any two computers in the world to transmit data in an encrypted channel. It is only encrypted on the data, not on the hardware, so it is called virtual. It has therefore become a tool for overturning the review. VPN is more basic than [shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html). It first virtualizes a network card through the operating system. After that, the data is encrypted by this network card. .

### Why are most VPNs unstable?

Because for the ordinary VPN, although the message content is encrypted, the message protocol is very detectable. If some small businesses use some open source protocols, the chances of being detected by the wall will increase greatly. For first-line merchants, they have the resources to do some secondary development on existing agreements to bypass the detection of the wall.

### What should I pay attention to when using VPN?

First of all, it is illegal to use VPN. However, the number of users using VPN in China is extremely large. It is impossible to punish all of them. It can only be said that killing chickens and monkeys, such as some [news using VPN](https:/ /www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-46823319). Of course, this is not to say that the punishment is random, but the first to punish those who browsed foreign politically sensitive websites and spread them. Therefore, when using VPN, you must remember to read-only, that is, only read information, not to spread information.
